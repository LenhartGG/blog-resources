## How to find a person who can help you get ahead at work如何找到一位能在工作中帮助你成功的人

And then I said to myself, "Well, how do you get a sponsor? And frankly, why do you need one?" Well, you need a sponsor, frankly, because as you can see, there's not one evaluative process that I can think of, whether it's in academia, health care, financial services, not one that does not have a human element. So that means it has that measure of subjectivity. There is a measure of subjectivity in who is presenting your case. There is a measure of subjectivity in what they say and how they interpret any objective data that you might have. There is a measure of subjectivity in how they say what they're going to say to influence the outcome. So therefore, you need to make sure that that person who is speaking, that sponsor, has your best interests at heart and has the power to get it, whatever it is for you, to get it done behind closed doors.

然后我对我自己说，“好吧，那你怎样才能得到一个举荐人呢？坦率地说，为什么你需要举荐人呢？ 好吧，你需要个举荐人，坦白说，因为你知道，我想不出有哪个评估过程，不论是在学术界，医疗界，还是金融服务界，不会涉及任何人为因素。所以这意味着一切都有主观因素。这主观的衡量标准在于谁在展示你的案例。这主观的衡量标准体现在他们说什么，以及他们以什么方式去 解释你提供的客观数据。这主观的衡量更体现在他们会怎么说来影响结果。因此，你要确保那个说话的人，那位举荐人，打心底为你争取最大的利益，并且有力量去争取，不管是不是为了你，在那闭门会议中搞定它。

But here's where the other currency is now most important. That is the relationship currency, and relationship currency is the currency that is generated by the investments that you make in the people in your environment, the investments that you make in the people in your environment. You cannot ask someone to use their hard-earned personal influential currency on your behalf if you've never had any interaction with them. It is not going to happen. So it is important that you invest the time to connect, to engage and to get to know the people that are in your environment, and more importantly to give them the opportunity to know you. Because once they know you, there's a higher probability that when you approach them to ask them to be your sponsor, they will in fact answer in the affirmative.

但在这里，另一种货币就显得尤为重要。那就是关系货币，并且关系货币产生于你在工作环境中做的人际投资，你在工作环境中做的人际投资。你不能要求别人把他们辛苦赚来的个人影响力货币白白浪费在你身上，如果你从来没和他们有任何互动，这一定不会发生。所以更重要的是，你需要花时间与他们建立联系，去互动并去了解在你环境中的那些人，更重要的是，给予他们了解你的机会。因为一旦他们认识你，当你接近他们时，你会有更大的机会请求他们成为你的举荐人。事实上，他们会给予你肯定。

I cannot tell you how important it is to have a sponsor. It is the critical relationship in your career. A mentor, frankly, is a nice to have, but you can survive a long time in your career without a mentor, but you are not going to ascend in any organization without a sponsor. It is so critical that you should ask yourself regularly, "Who's carrying my paper into the room? Who is carrying my paper into the room?" And if you can't answer who is carrying your paper into the room, then I will tell you to divert some of your hardworking energies into investing in a sponsor relationship, because it will be critical to your success.

我无法形容拥有一位举荐人是多么的重要，在你的职业生涯中，这是至关重要的关系。坦白说，如果你可以拥有一位导师，那很好，但是没有导师，你照样可以在你的职业生涯中生存，可是没有举荐人，你就很难在任何企业中得到晋升。这重要到你需要时时提醒自己，“谁是那个带着我的文件 走进房间的人？谁是那个带着我的文件走进房间的人？如果你回答不上来谁是那个带着你的文件走进房间的人，那么我会告诉你转移一些你埋头苦干的精力去投资一段举荐人的关系吧，因为它对你的成功至关重要。
